Title: Analysis of Nimet and Nasa Dataset: Cleaning, Feature Engineering, EDA, and Comparative Analysis

Description: This project involves cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and comparative analysis of raw data obtained from Nimet and Nasa. The dataset pertains to a specific location, and the objective is to identify similarities and eventually predict weather patterns. The data was cleaned using industry-standard techniques, followed by an in-depth exploratory analysis. Additionally, manual data acquisition was performed, and models were built to assess the performance of the raw data.
